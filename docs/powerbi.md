# Sample Power BI Report Instruction

When opening the pbit for the first time, you will need to input a series of parameters such as **Storage Account Name**, **SQL Server**, and **Database Name**. In addition, you will also need to type in a **Currency Code**, which will determine the Currency Formatting in your Power BI Report. Since the Cost Management API shows the billing in your local Currency, please type in your local Currency code, eg. type in **GBP** if you are billed in British Pounds.

Currently below Currencies are supported for the Currency Formatting in this sample report

- USD
- AUD
